> Pretrial inmates. Connecticut has begun publishing a daily census of every inmate held in jail while awaiting trial. Starting July 1, the database contains one row per inmate per day; each row includes basic demographic data (age, gender, race), as well as the inmateâ€™s bond amount, main offense, and jail location. Read more at: The New Haven Independent and TrendCT. Question: This release seems unprecedented; does any other state or country publish such detailed data on pretrial inmates?
